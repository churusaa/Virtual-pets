## Virtual Pets Amok

Do you remember Cyberpet? Tamagotchi? Digimon? Petz? Virtual pets like these were born in 1996. With your help, they will be reborn.

Our shelter houses organic and robotic pets! They are housed in a shelter and cared for by you. They have unique personalities. They can be adopted.

To adopt a pet, you must visit the shelter, choose your favorite of the bunch, give them a personal name, and take them home!

Now comes the fun part!

Taking care of your new pet:

Feeding - Your new pet loves water and food! make sure you check up on their thirst and hunger regularly, or else!

Playing - Make sure to play with your new pet and give them lots of attention! Your new pet can get bored easily so make sure you check up on them frequently!

Multiple Pets - Visit the shelter often to see what new pets have become available! Your pet always welcomes new friends!

Ouchies! - Even virtual pets can get hurt! If your pet has hurt themselves or become ill then a doctor visit is in store!
